Advanced Calendar PCF – Description

Advanced Calendar PCF is a flexible and extensible calendar control built using the Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) to address common limitations of standard date pickers in Power Apps and Model-Driven Apps.

The control supports advanced date selection scenarios such as single date selection, date range selection, and is designed to be easily extended to support multiple date selection and event-based rendering.

Advanced Calendar PCF integrates seamlessly with Dataverse and can optionally bind to datasets, enabling it to display, select, and manage dates in complex business scenarios without relying on external services or AI-based features.
